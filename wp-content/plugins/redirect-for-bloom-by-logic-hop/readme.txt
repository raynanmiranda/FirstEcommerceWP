== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How Redirects Work =
 
Redirect for Bloom by Logic Hop uses Javascript to perform the redirect only after a successful form submission. There may be a brief delay before the redirect occurs – During the delay, the Success Message Text area will be hidden. The success checkmark icon will still be displayed.
